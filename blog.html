      <li>
        DOM is Document Object Model.. The purpose of using DOM is that HTML
        pages can be easily modified with JavaScript programming language. The
        entire HTML DOM tree is created by JavaScript itself. We can then
        manipulate the Document object using the DOM. For example: adding new
        element attributes, styling and removing, modifying also. Creating page
        events to perform a specific action on the page etc.
      </li>

      <li>
        We can select HTML elements using by DOM methods like getElementById,
        getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector (here you
        can use for tag, class or id if very specific that is). And you can
        selecting whole html DOM elements by using querySelectorAll method.
      </li>

      <li>
        Event bubbling is the propagation of an event that stops from its origin
        up to the root element. In other words, when a user clicks on a button
        on the page, the event handler under that button propagates the event to
        its parent, its parent, and its parent again to the root element Html.
        The event notifies all elements above it that someone has clicked on it.
      </li>

      <li>
        Callback function is a function which can be called from another
        function parameter. And we can use chaining callback. We use callback
        functions to handle tasks that occur in response to events.
